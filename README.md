# mapscript-php7
Alternative PHP-Mapscipt for PHP7 with the good old C-code

The MapScript support for PHP7 through SWIG is still in development. In the meantime I could not wait anymore and modified the old PHP5 stuff to PHP7. Now almost is done, only OWSRequestObj.loadParams() remain.
On my machine (Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS whith PHP 7.0-20151012) all works fine.
