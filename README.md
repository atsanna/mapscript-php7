# mapscript-php7
Alternative PHP-Mapscipt for PHP7 with the good old C-code

The MapScript support for PHP7 through SWIG is still in development. In the meantime I could not wait anymore and translated the old PHP5 stuff to PHP7. Now almost is done. Only the clone-functions and OWSRequestObj.loadParams() remain.
On my machine (Ubuntu 16.04 whith PHP 7.0) all works fine.
